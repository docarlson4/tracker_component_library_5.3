The archive for the Matlab version of SCS is here. The Matlab version is
from
https://github.com/bodono/scs-matlab
A C version can be obtained from 
https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs

The Matlab interface for the C version appears to not be compatible with of
Matlab 2020b, so only the Matlab version is available right now.

Files that are not used have been compressed into "Unused Code.zip"
archives. Also, lines that would have printed intermediate results to the
console have been commented out.
