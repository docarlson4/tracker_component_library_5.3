In the e-mail below, the author of the C version of the NRLMSISE00 has
released his implementation the public domain contingent on the original
Fortran implementation being in the public domain. The original Fortran
implementation was created by employees of the U.S. Naval Research
Laboratory as official government work and thus is in the public domain.
