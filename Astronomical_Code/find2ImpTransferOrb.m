%%FIND2IMPTRANSFERORB Figure the optimal two-impulse maneuvers necessary to
%                 get a spacecraft from Cartesian position and velocity
%                 state vector stateVec1 to stateVec2. The impulse forces
%                 are applied at the beginning and at the end of the
%                 trajectory. Only a simpler Keplerian two-body system is
%                 considered. The maneuver is optimal either in that it
%                 minimizes the sum of the magnitudes of the change in the
%                 velocities (minimizing Newtonian kinetic energy/ fuel) or
%                 in minimizing the sum of the squares of the changes in
%                 the velocities. Only a zero-revolution solution is
%                 considered. Thus, this is not appropriate for Hohmann
%                 transfers as a much lower energy solution can be obtained
%                 by allowing for a single orbit to complete the transfer.
%
%INPUTS: stateVec1 A 6X1 vector consisting of position and velocity in a
%                  Cartesian inertial coordinate system where the
%                  gravitating body is at the origin.The units are assumed
%                  to be meters and meters per second.
%        stateVec2 The desired 6X1 state vector after the orbital maneuver.
%          costSel An optional string specifying the optimality criterion.
%                  Possible values are:
%                  'minAbsVelSum' (the default if omitted) Minimize the sum
%                                 of the magnitudes of the changes in
%                                 velocity for the impulse maneuvers.
%                  'minVelSquaredSum' Minimize the sum of the squares of
%                                 the mangnitudes of the changes in
%                                  velocity for the impulse maneuvers.
%             TMax An optional parameter setting an upper bound on the time
%                  of the optimal transfer. If omitted, the upper bound is
%                  set to 10 times the minimum time elliptical orbit
%                  between the points given by orbVelDet2PtMinEng. This
%                  parameter affects the convergence of the algorithm as a
%                  bounded line search method is used.
%               GM An optional value of the universal gravitational
%                  constant times the mass of the Earth. If omitted, the
%                  value Constants.WGS84GMWithAtmosphere is used. The
%                  units are m^3/sec^2.
%
%The function orbVelDet2Pt determines the velocities of an orbit given two
%points and a propagation time. The propagation time needed to optimize the
%selected cost function is unknown. This function solves for the optimal
%propagation time that minimizes the cost function using the fminbnd
%function, which performs a line search over a bounded region.
