function [Jul1,Jul2]=Cal2TDB(year,month,day,hour,minute,second,deltaT,clockLoc)
%%CAL2TDB Convert dates in terms of the Gregorian calendar in years,
%         months, days, hours, minutes and seconds with the time in
%         universal coordinated time (UTC) to a two-part Julian date in
%         barycentric dynamic time (TDB).
%
%INPUTS: year A year in the Gregorian calendar under UTC time.
%       month A month in the Gregorian calendar under UTC time;
%             1<=month<=12.
%         day An integer day in the Gregorian calendar under UTC time.
%             Days count from 1.
%        hour An integer hour under the Gregorian calendar under UTC time;
%             0<=hour<=23.
%      minute An integer minutes in the Gregorian calendar under UTC time;
%             0<=minute<=59.
%      second A double floating point second in the Gregorian calendar
%             under UTC time. This is normally less than 60, but can be a
%             value less than 61 or 59 at the right hour on a day with a
%             leap second.
%      deltaT An optional parameter specifying the offset between TT and
%             UT1 in seconds. If this parameter is omitted or an empty
%             matrix is passed, then the value of the function getEOP will
%             be used.
%    clockLoc An optional 3X1 vector specifying the location of the clock
%             in WGS-84 ECEF Cartesian [x;y;z] coordinates with units of
%             meters. Due to relativistic effects, clocks that are
%             synchronized with respect to TT are not synchronized with
%             respect to TDB. If this parameter is omitted or an empty
%             matrix is passed, then a clock at the center of the Earth is
%             used.
%
%OUTPUTS: Jul1, Jul2 Matrices of the time as pseudo-Julian dates in TDB
%                    where each row/column corresponds to the values in the
%                    same row/column of the input matrices.
%
%This function just calls the function Cal2TT and then TT2TDB. If deltaT is
%not passed, then getEOP is used to find it.
