function [yearFrac,secOfYear]=UTC2YearFrac(Jul1,Jul2)
%%UTC2YEARFRAC A function for converting a universal coordinated time
%              (UTC) given as a two-part pseudo-Julian to a decimal year in
%              the Gregorian calendar, accounting for leap years and leap
%              seconds. The fractional part of the year is the ratio of the
%              number of seconds elapsed in the year to the total number of
%              seconds in the year. This function also returns the total
%              number of seconds in the year. This is only valid from 1960
%              onward, as UTC was established in 1960.
%
%INPUTS: Jul1, Jul2  Vectors or matrices of the two parts of Julian dates
%                    given in UTC. The units of the date are days. The full
%                    date is the sum of both terms. The date is broken into
%                    two parts to provide more bits of precision. It does
%                    not matter how the date is split.
%
%OUTPUTS: yearFrac   A matrix of the year as a fractional date
%                    corresponding to the input dates. For example, 2005.25
%                    means that the year is 2005 and 1/4 of the seconds in
%                    the year have passed.
%        secOfYear   A matrix of the fractional seconds from the start of
%                    the year as implied by the given dates.
%
%The function determines the number of seconds passed in the year up to the
%current date by using UTC2DayCount for the basic day count and by
%differening cumLeapSec to determine the number of leap seconds from the
%start of the year to the current date.
%
%Note that the type of fractional years returned by this function should
%not be confused with Julian epochs, which are very similar and can be
%obtained using the function JulDate2JulEpoch.

%inserted at the end of the day, so the fractional part of the day is
%needed.

%The number of leap seconds from the start of the year to the day in

%These are just repeated to allows for matrix inputs to this function.

%The total number of seconds in the year.
