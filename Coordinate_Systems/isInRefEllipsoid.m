function val=isInRefEllipsoid(z,a,f)
%%ISINREFELLIPSOID Determine whether a point is inside of a reference
%                   ellipsoid centered at the origin and oriented with the
%                   z axis as the axis of rotation. This function is useful
%                   for approximating whether a target estimate is
%                   underground when terrain data are not available. The
%                   WGS-84 reference ellipsoid is a logical choice.
%
%INPUTS: z A point in [x;y;z] Cartesian coordinates.
%        a The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid. If this argument
%          is omitted, the value in Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%        f The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. If this
%          argument is omitted, the value in Constants.WGS84Flattening is
%          used.
%
%OUTPUTS: val True if the point z is within the ellipsoid and false if the
%             point is not within the reference ellipsoid.
