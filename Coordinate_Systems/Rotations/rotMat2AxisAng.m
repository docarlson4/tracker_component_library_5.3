function [u,theta,q]=rotMat2AxisAng(R,handed)
%%ROTMAT2AXISANG Any series of rotations in 3D can be expressed in terms of
%                a single rotation about a certain axis by a certain angle.
%                This function takes a rotation matrix and provides the
%                axis and angle of the rotation as well as a rotation
%                quaternion, if desired. The quaterion and rotation angle
%                can be expressed as either a right-handed or a left-handed
%                rotation. The default is right-handed.
%
%INPUTS: R A 3X3 orthonormal real rotation matrix.
%
%OUTPUTS: u,theta The 3X1 unit vector u and rotation angle theta in radians
%                 such that to rotate a vector v, one could call
%                 rotateVector(v,u,theta,handed) instead of multiplying
%                 M*v. theta is the angle by which one would have to
%                 perform a rotation about the axis u (with the handedness
%                 of the rotation given by handed) to rotate a vector v the
%                 same as if one evaluated M*v. Also, note that
%                 R=axisAng2RotMat(u,theta,handed).
%               q A quaternion corresponding to the axis-angle pair where
%                 q=[cos(theta/2);sin(theta/2)*u]; The first element is
%                 what many textbooks refer to as q0 or q4. The quaternion
%                 is ordered in terms of hypercomplex numbers as
%                 q(1)+i*q(2)+j*q(3)+k*q(4). The handedness of the
%                 quaternion matches handed (and the handedness of theta).
%          handed The handedness of the rotation angle. If omitted, it is
%                 assumed that the rotation is right-handed (the standard).
%                 Possible values are
%                 'right' The default if omitted. The rotation is right-
%                         handed.
%                 'left'  The rotation is left-handed. The rotation angle
%                         is counterclockwise when one is looking in the
%                         direction that the rotation axis points.
%
%The function calls rotMat2Quat to get the quaternion for the rotation and
%then calls quat2AxisAng to get the axis and angle.
