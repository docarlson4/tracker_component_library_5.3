/*CART2ELLIPSHARMONCPP  A C++ function to convert from Cartesian to
 *                      ellipsoidal harmonic coefficients.
 *
 *INPUTS: pointsHarmon A pointer to an array of doubles of length
 *                     3*numPoints to hold the converted points with
 *                     elements in the order of
 *                     [reduced latitude;longitude;semiminor axis]
 *        cartPoints   A pointer to an array of 3*numPoints doubles holding
 *                     [x;y;z] values of each of the Cartesian points to
 *                     convert.
 *        numPoints    The number of points that are to be converted.
 *                E    The linear eccentricity of the reference ellipsoid
 *                    that defines the ellipsoid harmonic system.
 *
 *OUTPUTS: None. The results are placed in pointsHarmon.
 *
 *Further comments are given in the Matlab file cart2EllipsHarmon.
