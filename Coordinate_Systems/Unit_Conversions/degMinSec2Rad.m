function rad=degMinSec2Rad(deg,min,sec)
%%DEGMINSEC2RAD Convert an angle given in degrees, arcminutes and
%               arcseconds to radians.
%
%INPUTS: deg A scalar or matrix number of degrees.
%        min A number of arcminutes, having the same dimensions as deg. If
%            omitted or an empty matrix is passed, this is assumed to be 0.
%        sec A number of arcseconds, having the same dimensions as deg. If
%            omitted or an empty matrix is passed, this is assumed to be 0.
%
%OUTPUTS: rad The angle or angles converted into radians, wrapped to -pi to
%             pi.
%
%There are 60 arcminutes per degree, 60 arcseconds per arcminute, and
%(180/pi) degrees per radians.
