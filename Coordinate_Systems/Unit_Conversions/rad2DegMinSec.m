function [deg,min,sec]=rad2DegMinSec(rad)
%%DEG2DEGMINSEC Convert angular radians to a representation in integer
%               degrees, arcminutes, and decimal arcseconds. This can be
%               useful for displaying angular quantities in a user-frieldy
%               manner.
%
%INPUTS: rad An angle in radians.
%
%OUTPUTS: deg The integer part of the input in degrees.
%         min The integer number of arcminutes.
%         sec A decimal number of arcseconds.
%
%If a negative number of radians is entered, then degrees, arcminutes and
%arcseconds will all come back negative.
%
%There are 60 arcminutes per degree, 60 arcseconds per arcminute, and
%(180/pi) degrees per radians.
