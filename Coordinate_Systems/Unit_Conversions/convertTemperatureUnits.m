function val=convertTemperatureUnits(val,unitOrig,unitDest)
%%CONVERTTEMPERATUREUNITS Convert values of temperature from one set of
%                         units to another.
%
%INPUTS: val The matrix or vector of values that are to be converted.
%   unitOrig, unitDes Two character strings indicating the units of val and
%            the units into which it is to be converted. The possible
%            values are:
%            'K' Kelvin    'C' Centigrade/ Celcius
%            'R' Rankine   'F' Fahrenheit
%
%OUTPUTS: val The values converted into the desired coordinate system.
%
%The conversions are standard and can be found in many places books and
%places online, such as at

%First, convert the value to Kelvin
switch(unitOrig)
    case 'K'
    case 'C'
        val=val+273.15;
    case 'R'
        val=val*(5/9);
    case 'F'
        val=(val-32)*(5/9)+273.15;
    otherwise
        error('The units provided for the source value are invalid.')
end

%Then convert the temperature in Kelvin to the desired temperature.
switch(unitDest)
    case 'K'
    case 'C'
        val=val-273.15;
    case 'R'
        val=val/(5/9);
    case 'F'
        val=32+(9/5)*(val-273.15);
    otherwise
        error('The units provided for the destination value are invalid.')
end
