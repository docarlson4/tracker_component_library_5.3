function zSpher=spherCD2SpherITRS(zCD,param1,param2,S11)
%%SPHERCD2SPHERITRS Convert a point given in spherical coordinates in
%          centered dipole (CD) coordinates into spherical coordinates in
%          the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS), a
%          standard Earth-Cenetred-Earth-fixed (ECEF) coordinate system. CD
%          coordinates is a type of coordinate system where the z-axis is
%          aligned with the magnetic dipole of the Earth (under a
%          dipole model). This coordinate system is useful when studying
%          the ionosphere.
%
%INPUTS: zCD One or more points given in terms of range, azimuth and
%            elevation, with the angles in radians, or in terms of just
%            azimuth and elevation if a conversion of directions is
%            desired, in CD coordinates. To convert N points, zCD is a 3XN
%            matrix with each column having the format [range;azimuth;
%            elevation] or it is a 2XN matrix with each column having
%            format [azimuth; elevation]. Azimuth is measured
%            counterclockwise from the x-axis in the x-y plane. Elevation
%            is measured up from the x-y plane (towards the z-axis).
% param1,param2,S11 These optional parameters specify the magnetic field
%            parameters from which the direction of the CD pole is derived.
%            These parameters are implied set based on how the function is
%            called:
%            1) spherCD2SpherITRS(zCD)
%               If all of the other parameters are omitted, then the CD
%               pole parameters for the latest epoch of the International
%               Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) are used; the Schmidt
%               semi-normalized coefficients are obtained using the
%               function getIGRFCoeffs.
%            2) spherCD2SpherITRS(zCD, year)
%               The parameters of the IGRF for the specified epoch year are
%               used. The year is in the Gregorian calendar and is
%               specified as noted in the comments to the getIGRFCoeffs
%               function.
%            3) spherCD2SpherITRS(zCD, year, model). This is the
%               same as centeredDipole2Sphere(zCD, year), except model
%               can be 'IGRF' or 'WMM' to specify which magnetic field
%               model to use. 'WMM' refers to the World magnetic model
%               using the function getWMMCoeffs. Note than an empty year
%               matrix can be passed to get the latest epoch year of either
%               model.
%            4) spherCD2SpherITRS(zCD,C10,C11,S11). In this
%               instance, the first few Schmidt semi-normalized
%               coefficients for a magnetic field model are given. These
%               are the only three coefficients used to define the
%               orientation of the CD pole. If using the getWMMCoeffs or
%               getIGRFCoeffs function to get the coordinates, then from
%               the outputs of those functions (specifying in the second
%               input that they should not be fully normalized), the
%               outputs C and S of the functions are used here as
%               C10=C(1+1,0+1), C11=C(1+1,1+1), S11=C(1+1,1+1).
%
%OUTPUTS: zSphere The points in zCD converted into spherical coordinates 
%                 under the selected model (systemType 0 in the Cart2Sphere
%                 function). The z axis is algined with the If zCD is 3XN,
%                 then zSphere consists of range as well as azimuth and
%                 elevation. If zCD was 2XN, then zSphere just consists of
%                 azimuth and elevation. All angles are in radians.
%
%The definition of centered dipole (CD) coordinates is taken from [1].
%However, as opposed to using the spherical trignonometric equations in the
%paper, the rotation is performed in Cartesian coordinates so as to avoid
%singularities.
