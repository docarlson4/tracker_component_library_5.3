function [zCartCD,rotMat]=ITRS2CartCD(zCart,param1,param2,S11)
%%ITRS2CARTCD Convert points given in the International Terrestrial
%             Reference System (ITRS), a standard Earth-Cenetred-Earth-
%             fixed (ECEF) coordinate system, in 3D Cartesian coordinates
%             into centered dipole (CD) coordinates, a type of coordinate
%             system where the z-axis is aligned with the magnetic dipole
%             of the Earth. This coordinate system is useful when studying
%             the ionosphere. Note that the inputs and outputs of this
%             function are in Cartesian coordinates, but many papers only
%             use CD coordinates in spherical form. The function
%             Cart2Sphere could be used to perform the conversion to
%             spherical form.
%
%INPUTS: zCart One or more points given in Cartesian coordinates in the
%              ITRS. zCart is a 3XN matrix with each column having the
%              format [x;y;z].
% param1,param2,S11 These optional parameters specify the magnetic field
%              parameters from which the direction of the CD pole is
%              derived. These aprameters are impied set base don how the
%              function is called:
%              1) ITRS2CartCD(zCart)
%                 If all of the other parameters are omitted, then the CD
%                 pole parameters for the latest epoch of the International
%                 Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) are used; the Schmidt
%                 semi-normalized coefficients are obtained using the
%                 function getIGRFCoeffs.
%              2) ITRS2CartCD(zCart, year)
%                 The parameters of the IGRF for the specified epoch year
%                 are used. The year is in the Gregorian calendar and is
%                 specified as noted in the comments to the getIGRFCoeffs
%                 function.
%              3) ITRS2CartCD(zCart, year, model). This is the same as
%                 spher2CenteredDipole(zSpher, year), except model can be
%                 'IGRF' or 'WMM' to specify which magnetic field model to
%                 use. 'WMM' refers to the World magnetic model using the
%                 function getWMMCoeffs. Note than an empty year matrix can
%                 be passed to get the latest epoch year of either model.
%              4) ITRS2CartCD(zCart,C10,C11,S11). In this instance, the
%                 first few Schmidt semi-normalized coefficients for a
%                 magnetic field model are given. These are the only three
%                 coefficients used to define the orientation of the CD
%                 pole. If using the getWMMCoeffs or getIGRFCoeffs function
%                 to get the coordinates, then from the outputs of those
%                 functions (specifying in the second input that they
%                 should not be fully normalized), the outputs C and S of
%                 the functions are used here as
%                 C10=C(1+1,0+1), C11=C(1+1,1+1), S11=C(1+1,1+1).
%
%OUTPUTS: zCartCD The points in zCart rotated into centered dipole
%               coordinates under the selected model. The ITRS and the CD
%               coordinate systems are related by a rotation.
%        rotMat The 3X3 rotation matrix such that
%               zCartCD(:,i)=rotMat*zCart(:,i).
%
%The definition of centered dipole (CD) coordinates is taken from [1],
%though the relations given in spherical coordinates are not used.

%The paper does not explicitly state it, but from Equation 5 of [1]
%(assuming one uses a four-quadrant inverse tangent), one can infer that
%the pole being used is given by the following vector in terms of
%geomagnetic components:
uCDPole=[-g11;-h11;-g10];
B0=norm(uCDPole);%Reference magnetic field, the "reduced moment" (Tesla)
uCDPole=uCDPole/B0;%Turn the pole direction into a unit vector.

%The sphericla geometric relations in the paper contain a number of
%singularities. Thus, it is best if the rotations take place in Cartesian
%coordinates.

%Rotation matrix from geocentric coordinates to centered-dipole
%coordinates. This rotates uCDPole to [0;0;1] --The z axis. The first
%rotation about the z axis makes the point where the pole is have zero
%longitude in CD coordinates.
