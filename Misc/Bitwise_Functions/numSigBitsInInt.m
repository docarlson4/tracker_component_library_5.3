function numBits=numSigBitsInInt(intVal)
%%NUMSIGBITSININT Given a positive integer value, return the number of
%                 significant bits in the integer. This is the total number
%                 of bits needed to represent the integer in binary without
%                 leading zeros. For example, numSigBitsInInt(1)=1,
%                 numSigBitsInInt(0)=0 and numSigBitsInInt(8)=4.
%
%INPUTS: intVal A positve, scalar integer value.
%
%OUTPUTS: numBits The number of bits needed to represent the integer.
%                 Negative inputs just return zero. Non-integer inputs
%                 return an error.
%
%The function just counts the number of right-shifts of the bits in the
%integer that are needed until the result is zero.
%
%For intVal>0, this result is the same as what one would expect from
%evaluating fix(log2(x))+1. However, one would expect a bitshifting
%implementation that works on integers to be faster than an implementation
%that evaluates a logarithm.
