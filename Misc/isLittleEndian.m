function isLittle=isLittleEndian()%%ISLITTLEENDIAN This function determines whetehr the operating system is%                running on a little endian processor. It does this using%                typecasting.%%INPUTS: None%%OUTPUTS: isLittle A boolean value that is true if the system is little%                  endian.%%The system is little endian if the most significant byte in a multi-byte%integer comes at the lowest memory address (we are discussing byte order,%not bit order). This function checks whether that is the case using a%uint16 value that is cast to two uint8 values.%%August 2020 David F.
