function unzippedData=readZipArchive(path2File,param2)
%%READZIPARCHIVE Read and decompress a single gzip compressed file or one
%                or more files from a zip archive into memory without
%                saving them to disk. Gzip archives only store a single
%                file, zip archives store multiple files. When reading
%                multiple files from a zip, one has the option of omitting 
%                invisible files. Note that decompressing a large file into
%                memory might cause the Java virtual machine (JVM) to run
%                out of memory (and thus, the decompression fails), as
%                its memory usage is capped in Matlab. The memory for the
%                JVM must be a few times larger than the size of the file
%                being decompressed. The memory that Matlab allows for the
%                JVM is independent of the amount of RAM in the computer.
%                One might have to increase the memory allotment for the
%                JVM to extract large files. This is done via
%                Preferences->General->Java Heap Memory.
%                 
%INPUTS: path2File A Matlab character string representing the path to the
%                  zip archive. For example './text.zip'. The path should
%                  be OS X/UNIX-style with '/' to indicate folders, not '\'.
%                  If the file extension is .gz, then it is assumed to be
%                  a gzip file. Otherwise, it is assumed to be a zip
%                  archive.
%           param2 An optional parameter that is only relevant when
%                  decoding a zip file, not a gzip file. If this is
%                  omitted, then all of the files in the archive are
%                  decoded and invisibles files are omitted. If param2 is
%                  a character string, then it is
%                  fileName: An optional string representing the name of a
%                  single file in the archive that is to be decompressed.
%                  This must be the full path within the zip file. For
%                  example, if someone compressed test.txt with other files
%                  in the folder test_folder, then the path to that file
%                  would be 'test_folder/test.txt'. If fileName is provided
%                  but is not in the archive, then an error will occur.
%                  Otherwise, one can set param2 to a boolean value
%                  decodeInvis, whereby all files are decoded such that
%                  If this is true, then invisible files are also decoded,
%                  and if this is false, then invisible files are not
%                  decoded. The default if omitted is false. See the
%                  function fileIsInvisible for more on how files are
%                  determined invisible.
%
%OUTPUTS: unzippedData A numFiles cell array containing the unzipped
%                      data and the names of the unzipped files.
%                      unzippedData{1,i} contains the name of the ith 
%                      files and unzippedData{2,i} contains the contents
%                      of the file as an array of uint8 values. If a zipped
%                      text file is being read, then char(unzippedData{2,i})
%                      will return a Matlab string of the contents of the
%                      file. When decoding a gzip archive,
%                      unzippedData{1,1} will just be the name of the
%                      archive without the .gz extension as gzip is a pure
%                      compression routine and does not provide information
%                      on what was compressed.
%
%One can call functions in Java directly from Matlab. Java's util library
%contains a zip class for manipulating zipped files. This function just
%uses the appropriate routines from Java's library. It is not as fast as it
%could be, though, since the data must be read one byte at a time due to
%limitations in Matlab.
%
%Matlab has a built-in function, unzip. However, that function unzips the
%data onto the disk, not into memory. This function makes use of the
%undocumented com.mathworks.mlwidgets.io.InterruptibleStreamCopier Java
%class so that one does not have to copy data very slowly byte by byte to
%decompress it.
%
%This function can be called as
%unzippedData=readZipArchive(path2File,fileName);
%To decode a single file or as
%unzippedData=readZipArchive(path2File,decodeInvis);
%to decode the whole archive, with the boolean decodeInvis to indicate
%whether invisible files should be decoded or as
%unzippedData=readZipArchive(path2File);
%where the whole archive without invisible files is decoded into memory.
