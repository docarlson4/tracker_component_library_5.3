/**SIMPASTROREFPARAM Obtain the parameters A and B for a very simple
*                    astronomical refraction model of the form:
*                    DeltaZ=A*tan(zetaObs)+B*tan(zetaObs)^3, where zetasObs
*                    is the observed zenith angle of a celestial body and
*                    DeltaZ is the bias due to refraction that should be
*                    subtracted from zetaObs to get the true direction of
*                    arrival. Such a model is invalid for observed zenith
*                    angles near 90 degrees. However, the function
*                    simpAstroRefrac, which uses these constants, uses a
*                    modified formula that is more robust.
*
*INPUTS: R The relative humidity at the observer (between 0 and 1). If
*          this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then
*          Constants.standardRelHumid is used.
*        P The atmospheric pressure at the observer in Pascals (N/m^2). If
*          this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then
*          Constants.standardAtmosphericPressure is used.
*        T The air temperature at the observer in degrees Kelvin. If this
*          parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then
*          Constants.standardTemp is used.
*       wl The wavelength at which the observation is made in units of
*          meters. If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
*          passed, then a wavelength of 0.574 micrometers is used, which
*          is in the visible spectrum (a rather yellow color).
*
*OUTPUTS: A The A value for the model in radians.
*         B The B value for the model in radians.
*
*This function is just a wrapper for the function iauRefco in the
*International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental
*Astronomy library.
*
*The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
*CompileCLibraries function.
*
*The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
*[A,B]=simpAstroRefParam(R,P,T,wl);
*or
*[A,B]=simpAstroRefParam();
