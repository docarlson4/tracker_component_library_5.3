function val=inHyperrect(P,rectMin,rectMax)%%INHYPERRECT Determine whether a point is within a given axis-aligned%             rectangular or hyperectangular region.%%INPUTS: P A kX1 vector.%  rectMin A kX1 vector of the lower bounds of each of the dimensions of%          the k-dimensional hyperrectangle.%  rectMax A kX1 vector of the upper bounds of the hyperectangle.%%OUTPUTS: val A boolean value that is true if the hyperrectangles intersect%             and false otherwise.%%December 2013 David F.
