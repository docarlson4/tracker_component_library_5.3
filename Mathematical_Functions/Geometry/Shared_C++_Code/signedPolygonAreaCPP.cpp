/*SIGNEDPOLYGONAREACPP A direct C++ implementation implementation of an
 *                  algorithm to calculate the signed area of a
 *                  non-self-intersecting 2D polygon given its vertices.
 *                  More comments on the implementation are given in the
 *                  Matlab implementation signedPolygonArea.m and its C++
 *                  version signedPolygonArea.cpp, which calls this
 *                  subroutine.
