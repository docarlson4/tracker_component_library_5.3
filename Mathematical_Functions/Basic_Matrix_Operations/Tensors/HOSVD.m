function [U,S]=HOSVD(X)
%%HOSVD Evaluate the high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) of a
%       tensor, also known as a Tucker decomposition. The Tucker
%       decomposition can have multiple solutions, and the HOSVD is just
%       one possible solution, though not necessarily the best one. it is,
%       however, simple to compute. The HOSVD is akin to a generalization
%       of the concept of singular value decomposition.  Though only the
%       left-singular vectors are used, the full matrix can still be
%       recreated. Thus, when run with a matrix input, this produces a
%       slightly different type of decomposition than the standard svd
%       command.
%
%INPUTS: X The hypermatrix (tensor) whose Tucker decomposition is desired.
%          This should have 2 or more modes. For example, a 4-mode
%          hypermatrix would be addressable as X(i1,i2,i3,i4). The matrix
%          can be real or complex.
%
%OUTPUTS: U A cell array of orthogonal matrices from the decomposition.
%         S The core tensor of the decomposition. See the example below to
%           see how the outputs are used to reconstruct X.
%
%The algorithm is written to be consistent with the default n-way
%matricization operation of tensor2Mat.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%An example of how the decomposition can be used to decompose and then
%reconstruct a tensor is as follows:
% X=zeros(3,2,3);
% X(1,1,1)=1;
% X(1,1,2)=1;
% X(2,1,1)=1;
% X(2,1,2)=-1;
% X(2,1,3)=2;
% X(3,1,1)=2;
% X(3,1,3)=2;
% X(1,2,1)=2;
% X(1,2,2)=2;
% X(2,2,1)=2;
% X(2,2,2)=-2;
% X(2,2,3)=4;
% X(3,2,1)=4;
% X(3,2,3)=4;
% 
% [U,S]=HOSVD(X);
% 
% XRec=S;
% for n=1:length(U)
%     XRec=nModeProd(XRec,U{n},n);
% end
%
%One will observe that XRec is equal (within finite precision bounds) 
%to the original tensor X. 
%
%The algorithm is as in [1], though the definition of the n-way
%matricization is consistent with the more commonly used version, as in
%[2].
