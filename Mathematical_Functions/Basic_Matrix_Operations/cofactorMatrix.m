function C=cofactorMatrix(A)%%COFACTORMATRIX Compute the cofactor matrix of a square matrix A. The cofactor%     matrix of a matrix A is one such that C(i,j)=(-1)^(i+j)det(A_{i,j}), where%     A_{i,j} is the matrix A with row i and column j removed.%%INPUTS: A An nXn square matrix. The elements can be real or complex. The%          matrix can be singular.%%OUTPUTS: C The nXn cofactor matrix of the matrix A.%%The adjugate of a matrix is defined in Ch. 4 of [1] as the transpose of the%cofactor matrix C. This function just calls adj(A) to get the adjugate and then%takes the transpose of the result.%%REFERENCES:%[1] K. M. Abadir and J. R.
