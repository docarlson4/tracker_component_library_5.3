function x=realCepstrum(x,N)%%REALCEPSTRUM Compute the real cepstrum. The real cepstrum is the inverse%              Fourier transform of the real logarithm of the magnitude of%              the Fourier transform of a real sequence. The cepstrum is%              often used in signal identification. The real cepstrum plays%              a role in the design of certain filters.%%INPUTS: x An xDimX1 or 1XxDim real sequence.%        N The length of the discrete Fourier transforms to use in the%          computation of the cepstrum. If this parameter is omitted or an%          empty matrix is passed, then the default of N=length(x) is used.%%OUTPUTS: x The real cepstrum of the input signal x. This will be length-N.%%The computation of the real cepstrum is described in [1]. However, the%implementation here is more straighforward.%%REFERENCES:%[1] T. F. Quatieri and J. M.
