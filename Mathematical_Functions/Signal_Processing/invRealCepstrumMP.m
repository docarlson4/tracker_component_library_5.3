function x=invRealCepstrumMP(x,N)%%INVREALCEPSTRUMMP Compute the minimum phase reconstruction of a real%          signal given its real cepstrum. The real cepstrum is the inverse%          Fourier transform of the real logarithm of the magnitude of the%          Fourier transform of a real sequence. The cepstrum is often used%          in signal identification. The real cepstrum plays a role in the%          design of certain filters.%%INPUTS: x An xDimX1 or 1XxDim real cepstrum sequence.%        N The length of the discrete Fourier transforms to use in the%          computation of the cepstrum. If this parameter is omitted or an%          empty matrix is passed, then the default of N=length(x) is used.%%OUTPUTS: x The real minimum phase reconstruction of the signal. This will%           be length-N.%%The reconstruction is described in [1], where Equation 2 provides a simple%finite impulse response (FIR) filter that is necessary for the correct%reconstruction.%%EXAMPLE:%This is the example given in [1]. To four places after the decimal point,%the reconstructed signal equals the original signal.% x=zeros(1024,1);% x(1:2)=[1;1/0.99];% invRealCepstrumMP(realCepstrum(x))%The true value of the real cepstrum is x(1)=log(1/0.99) and%x(n+1)=-(-0.495)^n for abs(n)>0, as noted in [1]. To four places after the%decimal point, the minimum phase reconstruction is  x(0+1)=1.0101,%x(1+1)=1 and the rest of x is zero.%%REFERENCES:%[1] T. F. Quatieri and J. M.
