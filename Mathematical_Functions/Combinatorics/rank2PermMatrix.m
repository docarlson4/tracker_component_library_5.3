function chi=rank2PermMatrix(rank,n,dim)
%%RANK2PERMMATRIX Obtain the permutation matrix corresponding to a
%                 permutation of a given lexicographic order. The matrix
%                 can be used to rearrange n stacked vectors dim
%                 dimensions.
%
%INPUTS: rank The order of the desired permutation of 0:(n-1) (or 1:n)
%             in lexicographic order. Note  that 0<=rank<=(n!-1).
%           n The number of elements in the desired permutation; the
%             number of things that might be reordered with this matrix.
%         dim The dimensionality of the n things being reordered.
%
%OUTPUTS: chi The permutation matrix (consisting of ones and zeros) that
%             can rearrange n stacked vectors of dimensionality dim.
%
%Given an (n*dim)X1 vector v of n stacked subvectors of dimension dim, 
%chi*v rearranges the subvectors in v according to the given permutation. 
%For a more computationally efficient procedure of rearranging the 
%subvectors, consider using the function getPermIndices.
