function idx=findFirstMax(arr)
%%FINDFIRSTMAX Given an array of sorted vector of values in increasing
%              order, which might be full of duplicates, find the first
%              occurrence of the maximum value.
%
%INPUTS: arr A vector of values, with possible repeats, sorted in
%            increasing order.
%
%OUTPUTS: idx The index of the first occurrence of the maximum value
%             (last) element in arr.    
%
%The easiest way to find the first occurrence of the maximum value is to
%scan downward in the array from the end until a value different from the
%maximum value is found. However, that approach has a bad worst-case
%accuracy if all of the elements in the array have the same value. Thus,
%this method first checks for the easiest solutions, and then uses
%something akin to a binary search technique to find the first occurrence
%of the maximum value.

N=length(arr);

%If there is only one element, then the problem is trivial.
if(N==1)
    idx=1;

%Check for the simplest solution: The last element is the only maximum.
maxVal=arr(N);
if(arr(N-1)~=maxVal)
    idx=N;

%In this case, we must perform a binary search for the second highest
%element.

       maxIdx=midIdx;
    else
       minIdx=midIdx;
    end
end

if(maxIdx==minIdx)
    idx=maxIdx;
else
    if(arr(minIdx)==maxVal)
        idx=minIdx;
    else
        idx=maxIdx;
