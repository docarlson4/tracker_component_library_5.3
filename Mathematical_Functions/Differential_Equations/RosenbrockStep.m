function [xPredMain,xPredSubsid,k,orders]=RosenbrockStep(xCur,tCur,f,deltaT,fCur,J,dfdt,order)
%%ROSENBROCKSTEP Perform a single step of a Rosenbrock method whose main
%                integrating order is given by order. All implemented
%                Rosenbrock routines are embedded routines, meaning that a
%                secondary result of a different order, either one order
%                higher or one lower, can also be returned along with the
%                order of the second output. The second output can be used
%                in an algorithm that has an adaptive set size, such as in
%                the function RosenbrockAdaptiveOverRange. Rosenbrock
%                methods are diagonal implicit Runge Kutta methods that are
%                often well-suited for use with stiff ordinary differential
%                equations. That is, the algorithm is for integrating
%                dx/dt=f(x,t) given initial conditions (x0,t0) when the
%                form of f makes it such that standard Runge-Kutta methods
%                will fail/ will be required to take extremely small
%                stepsizes. However, unlike Runge-Kutta methods, Rosenbrock
%                methods require that derivative information be provided.
%                To integrate over a range of values adaptively choosing
%                the stepsize, the function RosenbrockAdaptiveOverRange
%                should be used.
%
%INPUTS: The function can either be called with one input as
%        [orders,isFSAL]=RosenbrockStep(order,solutionChoice)
%        to just get both of the orders of a particular method whose main
%        order is given by order (see below for details), or it can be run
%        as
%        [xPred,xPredSubsid,dxdt,orders,isFSAL]=RosenbrockStep(xCur,curT,f,fCur,deltaT,Jacobian,dfdt,order)
%        to actually do a full step and provide the orders. All of the
%        inputs in the full step are:
%           xCur The value of the (scalar or vector) state over which
%                integration is being performed.
%           tCur The time at which xCur is taken.
%              f f(x,t) returns the derivative of x with respect to time
%                taken at time t.
%           fCur The value f(xCur,tCur). This is explicitly provided rather
%                than just using the function f, because when performing
%                multiple steps, sometimes the value is computed while
%                computing xPredSubsid and can thus be reused on the next
%                step. If an empty matrix is provided, then this function
%                will just compute fCur from f.
%           deltaT The size of the single (time) step over which the 
%                integration is performed.
%              J The symmetric derivative matrix of f with respect to the
%                components of xCur. For example, the function numjac could
%                be used to numerically approximate the Jacobian.
%           dfdt The derivative of f with respect to t.
%           order The main integration order of the Rosenbrock method.
%                If this parameter is omitted, then the default order of
%                2 is used. Orders can range from 2 to 3. Given order 2,
%                the Rosenbrock formula of [2] is used. Given order 3, the
%                Rosenbrock formula of [1] is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: If the function is run with one input as
%         [orders,isFSAL]=RosenbrockStep(order)
%         Then there are just two outputs, orders and isFSAL, described
%         below.
%         Otherwise, if the stepsize is such that a certain matrix based on
%         the jacobian and stepsize is not full rank, then all empty
%         matrices (except for order) are returned. In such an instance,
%         change the step size and try again. Otherwise, all of the
%         outputs are
%           xPredMain The state propagated forward an interval of deltaT
%                     at the order of precision given by the input order.
%                     This is the main integration order.
%         xPredSubsid The subsidiary estimate. This is a different order
%                     than the main integration order can can be used in
%                     algorithms that adaptively adjust the stepsize.
%                   k The values of the derivatives f evaluated at various
%                     points as determined by the selected algorithm. These
%                     can sometimes be reused in interpolation routines to
%                     reduce the number of computations required. In all of
%                     the methods, k(:,1) is equal to f(xVal,curT). In
%                     FSAL methods, k(:,end) is
%                     f(xPredMain,curT+deltaT)
%              orders A 2X1 vector whereby order(1)=order, the input
%                     parameter, and orders(2) is the order of xPredSubsid.
%                     The value of orders(2) depends on the algorithm
%                     chosen by the combination of the order and
%                     solutionChoice inputs.
%              isFSAL Indicates whether the first evaluation of the f of
%                     the next step is equal to k(end,:)'. If so, this can
%                     be passed to the function on the next step rather
%                     than having to make an additional evaluation of f.

%Rosenbrock methods are diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta methods that perform
%only a single iteration of Newton's method each step to solve the implicit
%equations. The Rosenbrock formula used are the 2(3) formula in [2] used in
%Matlab's ode23s function, and the 3(4) formula in Section 5 of [1].
