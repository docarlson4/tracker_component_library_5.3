/*MMOSPAAPPROXCPP A C++ implementation of aan approximate minimum MOSPA
 *                optimization algorithm.
 *
 *INPUTS: MMOSPAEst  An array with xDim*numtar elements to hold the
 *                   approxiamte MMOSPA estimate.
 *        orderList  An array with numTar*numHyp element to hold the
 *                   ordering of the targets going into the approximate
 *                   MMOSPA estimate.
 *        x         An xDim * numTar * numHyp array that holds
 *                  numHyp hypotheses each consisting or numTar targets
 *                  (or generic vectors) with xDim dimensions per target
 *                  (per generic vector).
 *        w         A numHyp X 1 vector of the probabilities of each of
 *                  the numHyp hypotheses in x. The elements must all be
 *                  positive and sum to one.
 *        xDim      The size of the first dimension that x splits into.
 *        numTar    The size of the second dimensions that x splits into
 *        numHyp    The size of the third dimensions that x splits into.
 *        numScan   The number of forward scans of the approximation
 *                  algorithm to perform.
 *
 *OUTPUT: The output is placed in MMOSPAEst and orderList and is
 *        The MMOSPA estimate and the ordering idices of the hypotheses.
 *
 * The algorithm as well as the concept of MOSPA error are described in
 * detail in 
 * D. F. Crouse, "Advances in displaying uncertain estimates of multiple
 * targets," in Proceedings of SPIE: Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and
 * Target Recognition XXII, vol. 8745, Baltimore, MD, Apr. 2013.
