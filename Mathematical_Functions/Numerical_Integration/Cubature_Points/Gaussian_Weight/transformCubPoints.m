function xi=transformCubPoints(xi,mu,S)
%%TRANSFORMCUBPOINTS Transform a set of cubature points for a normal(0,I)
%                    distribution to approximation a normal distribution
%                    with mean mu and covariance matrix S*S'.
%
%INPUTS: xi A numDim X numCubaturePoints matrix containing the cubature
%           points for a normal(0,I) distribution. (Each "point" is a
%           vector). The weights associated with the points do not need to
%           be transformed when applying the points to other Gaussian
%           distributions
%        mu A numDim X 1 vector that is the desired mean of the transformed
%           points.
%         S A numDum X numDim lower-triangular square root of the
%           covariance matrix of the desired distribution. If P is the
%           covariance matrix of the desired distribution, then one can
%           obtain S as S=chol(P,'lower');
%
%OUTPUTS: xi The cubature points transformed to be useful in approximating
%            integrals over a normal distribution with mean mu and
%            covariance matrix S*S'.
