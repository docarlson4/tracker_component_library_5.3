EXPLANATION OF THE 2D ASSIGNMENT SAMPLE CODE

The example implemented in this folder demonstrates how 2D assignment
algorithms can be used as well as also how differences in algorithmic
implementation affect performance. The file compare2DAssign runs the
example. The files assign2DAlt.cpp, assign2DByCol.c, and assign2DByCol.m
are alternative implementations of the assign2D function that is in the
library. More details are given in the relevant files.
